The basic idea of Mod-Bot is creating a Modular-Trading-Bot which provides powerful customization options of trading strategies. The bot consists of 3 Main Components. Sources, Channels and the Bot itself. The Sources define from where the Bot is pulling data of a specific ERC20 Token. For example a source could be a social Media Platform like Twitter which can provide information of sentiment or popularity, or in another case a Crypto-Stock-Price API which provides information about the course of a token. The sources are the Data-Provider. 

What evaluates the data and makes it usable by the bot are the channels. The Channels are Interfaces which can be Open-Source. The basic function of them is to get Data, evaluate it and return a Value indicating profitability and maybe risk. The Basic interface of the Channel is set so it can interact with the bot. The important part is how it gets the Data and how it will evaluate it. This can be individually done for a Channel in combination with a source. For example one Channel analyses the popularity of a token on Twitter, another channel interacts with Twitter as well but returns semantic representation of the token. Another example would be the evaluation of exchange values. One channel could interact with a Crypto Currency API and evaluate and try to predict its course by using Fibonacci algorithms or in a different Channel use the EMA method. This setup provides an interesting combination of sources and channels which can be programmed Open-Source by people around the world and then be integrated in the trading bot. 

The last step is the feedback to the trading bot itself. This feedback can be weightend. By giving different weights to the feedback of channels, the bot can decide which of the used channels have been trust-worthy and which haven’t and therefore make better assumptions. The weigtening can be done with Feed-Forward and Sweep-Backward neural Networks or with integrated Machine Learning techniques. In order for the bot to evaluate these Weights, the bot would have 3 Modes. These 3 modes are:
•	Backtesting
•	Passive Mode
•	Tradebot
The Backtesting mode would analyize past data and make trades based on this data. The advantage is, the bot can then analyse the outcome of the predictions and investments it made and therefore can validate if he was right or now. This Was the bot could tinker its weight to a point, where he would have been successful in the past. 
The second mode for evaluation would be passive mode. The passive mode is a mode in which the bot uses its set information to make imaginary trades live. This mode obviously takes time to train, because the data is provided live and therefore the evaluation can only be done so far. The more the bot can train in this environment, the better. 
The last mode is the active trading bot. In this state the bot uses its set parameters to actively move funds in trades, make investments and/or sell assets.  This mode is only recommended once the bot has already been through some training, meaning the weights have already had some evaluation going through them. 

So the most important part of Mod-Bot are its variety of sources and usage of different channels of that source in order to customize a Trade Bot to the strategic beliefs of the user. But what does the bot itself do ? The bot its self is mainly using its user-defined channels to evaluate which tokens to buy best and which tokens to sell if he holds a certain amount of it. An interesting component here is, that the bot can use all channels to access the data of different tokens. With this, the bot can have a broad overview of what tokens are good for investment and which tokens need to be sold if assets of them are held. 

Furthermore Mod-Bot could also be specifically configured and implement some basic Trading strategies. For example one strategy would be Short Term profits. Meaning the bot is using the evaluated data to decided which tokens are volatile but secure enough to make short Term profits by buying and selling them over a short amount of time. The opposite which would be a long term investment strategy would not take risks that high and would try to play it save in general, so only Tokens which show longer upwards trajectory or have a behaviour which predicts so, would be an investment choice.
